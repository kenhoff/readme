## Eating frogs

Sometimes you'll see me use a repeating trello card or file named `frogs.txt`. This is usually just a list of chores  - they're usually not fun for me (responding to email, triaging issues, following up on a sales pipeline), but it's important that I do them regularly.

This is a reference to a quote ([dubiously](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/03/eat-frog/)) attributed to Mark Twain - loosely, it says "if you have to eat a frog today, eat the frog the first thing in the morning. If you have to eat two frogs, then eat the biggest, slimiest one first."

## Yak shave

I have no idea where this term came from - but, there's [a clip of Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fnfeuoh4s8) that illustrates this perfectly.

The general idea is that

"Yak shave" can be a noun or a verb - sometimes you have to yak shave a problem, sometimes the problem is just a big yak shave.

This goes pretty hand-in-hand with "unknown unknowns" on a project - sometimes you're just trying to fix that one little but, but then one thing leads to another and pretty soon you're rebuilding the entire application.

From what I can tell, the only way to avoid yak shaves is with experience. More experience means fewer unknown unknowns on a project, which means that I can think all the way through a problem without needing to necessarily investigate and learn all of the factors in play.
